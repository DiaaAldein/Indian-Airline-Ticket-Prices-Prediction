Airline Ticket Prices in India - Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling

Project Prepared by: Diaa Aldein Alsayed Ibrahim Osman
Prepared for: Epsilon AI Institute

Background:

This dataset contains price (airfare) data for flights between major cities in India. India stands as one of the largest aviation hubs globally.

Project Overview:

In this project, we're diving into the Airline Ticket Prices in India dataset to understand how ticket prices work. Our main goal is to create a smart computer model that can predict ticket prices based on different factors. By using tools like data analytics and machine learning, we want to find helpful information in the data.

Who Will Benefit:

This project aims to assist airlines, travel agencies, and travelers. For airlines and agencies, the model can provide insights for effective pricing strategies. Travelers can benefit by gaining a better understanding of how ticket prices are determined, helping them make informed choices and possibly find more affordable options.

Dataset Description:

The dataset comprises 10,683 instances and 11 features. The data is unclean, with missing values, and not all instances and features may be necessary to achieve the project's goals.
